# Patients_appointments_analysis

This is my submission to the first project in Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree (After finishing the professional, as there is an overlap)

in this project we go over the patients' appointments in brazil, and try to find whether or not a patients will show up for the appointment based on some other data, including their medical condition, whether they showed up before, how many messages they received, etc..

If you trying to do the project on Udacity's Nanodegree, feel free to check out my solution, but please don't copy it :)
